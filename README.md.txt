# Analysis and recommendation for campaign 
## Overview of Project
### Purpose

Use Excel to analyze the campaign data and find the effective way or strategy to raise the funding for Loise’s project.

## Analysis and Challenges
* We use Excel file – specifically using functions like Pivot table, line graph and bar graph to find what factors might contribute the most success to a campaign. 
* Challenge: There is an excel challenge. When we are doing the count for the outcome. I was hoping using the filter and then count function to do it. However, if we use filter function, we can’t use count function together. Therefore, the module suggests using COUNTIFS function to do all the filters and count at the same time.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
See results.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
See results.
## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
* Our final analysis we are using subcategory “Theater” and looks like May will be a good time to do the campaign. 
* We notice that some of the years did well, and some years didn’t. Maybe we can investigate some major events or holidays of the years and see which events brought the campaign up or down.  
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
* Looks like the goals set up between 0~25,000 have higher chances to accomplish the goals (successful rate is 45%~76%). Maybe we will suggest having a smaller goal for funding projects and doing a good number of them is better than have a few big projects and have a higher chance to fail.  
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
* I think it is good to have the data from different countries. However, different countries have different culture factors that we might need to consider. It might be good to add more culture or local information/factors from each country and make the data more completed.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
* We can have another table to show the time frame (launch date and deadline) and how much they raise during the time frame. Use Pivot table to gather the data with some subcategories and create a bar graph. Then we can see each time frame they raise how much under a specific subcategory. So we can know some projects should go long and some can go short.
